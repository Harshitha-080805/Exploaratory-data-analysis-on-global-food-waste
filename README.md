This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of food waste trends globally between 2018 and 2024 using Python. 
We analyze a dataset of over 5,000 records from 20 countries covering food categories, economic losses, per capita waste, and household behavior. 
The goal is to derive insights to support sustainability initiatives and inform data-driven policy decisions.
**Key Objectives**
Trend Analysis: Country-wise and year-wise food waste patterns.
Category Insights: Which food types contribute most to waste.
High-Impact Zones: Countries with the highest economic losses.
Household Behavior: Share of waste from households.
Economic Impact: Correlation between waste volume and financial loss.
**Tool**	
Python-Core programming language
Pandas-Data manipulation
NumPy-Numerical computations
Matplotlib-Visualizations
Seaborn-Statistical visualizations
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab	Development Environment
